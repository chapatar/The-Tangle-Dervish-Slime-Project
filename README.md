# The-Tangle-Dervish-Slime-Project
Game Progression: You need to have gone into the Glass Desert, and have poured ancient water on at least one plant thing.

Game Knowledge: How to make Largos and the ability to combat Tarr slimes.

What This Largo Targets: Unlike Boom and Rad slime Largos, this Largo targets the player's source of income (slimes), instead of the player directly. 

Why This Largo Is Dangerous: To understand why this combonation is dangerous, let's look at the two slimes used to make this Largo. The Dervish slime is unique in the fact that it can make tornados. And if you don't care for this slime, it will become the avatar of wind, creating cyclones everywhere in your ranch! Now, let's look at the Tangle slime. The Tangle slime is known for two different things. One thing, is that they can use their vines to grab food and plorts around them. The other thing is the pollen they spread around, which leads to slime aggitation. This can lead to a bunch ot things, like the Dervish Slime becoming the Avatar of Wind, Crystal slimes becoming the lord of all things spikey, and Boom slimes exploding so much that TNT cannons are put to shame. If you put these skill sets together, they can easily ravage any ranch that fails to take care of them. It also kills slimes, as these two also spread around so many plorts that Tarrs are everywhere.

First Step: You need to head over to the plant thing you watered. There will be a bunch of slimes bouncing around. The ones we are looking for is a tangle slime (the slime that is grabbing everything with vines), and the dervish slime(the slime that is litterally a tornado). If you see a tornado or vines, head over to catch the slime you need.
Second Step: Head back to your ranch with both slimes in tow, and put them in an empty corral.
Third Step: Get pieces of meat, and pieces of fruit and head back to the corral.
Fourth Step: Do the Gordo Making Process, and you have your slime Largo. GOOD LUCK!
